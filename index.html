Hey Andre,

I just felt, I had to say one last goodbye. Iâ€™ve made up my mindâ€”Iâ€™m just going to leave you alone. Not because I stopped caring, but because I care for your mental health, and I think this is whatâ€™s best sadly, for your sake. I never wanted to bring pain into your life Andre, and if stepping away is what brings you peace, then thatâ€™s what I want most. :/

Iâ€™m sorry. If I COULD'VE done better, I would have. And maybe I couldâ€™ve, that's what kills me to think about. But Iâ€™ll always carry that. But I want you to know something thatâ€™s never changedâ€”I love you. I really do, and I always will. I just feel itâ€™s better for you if I love you from a distance from now on.

Please live your life, fully and freely. You're going to do so many incredible thingsâ€”I truly believe that. Please donâ€™t worry about me. This isnâ€™t goodbye in a scary or sad wayâ€”just the quiet kind, the one that lets you move on without weight or guilt. Thatâ€™s all I want FOR YOU now: freedom, joy, and peace.

Iâ€™m not blocking you or cutting you off with anger. Iâ€™m just quietly stepping back, with love in my heart, so you can breathe easy again.

If it makes it easier for youâ€¦ just forget I existed. Iâ€™ll still be rooting for you.

Take care of yourself, Andre. Youâ€™ve got this.

â€”Ryan
