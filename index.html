    Hey Andre,

    I just felt, I had to say one last goodbye. I’ve made up my mind—I’m just going to leave you alone. Not because I stopped caring, but because I care for your mental health, and I think this is what’s best sadly, for your sake. I never wanted to bring pain into your life Andre, and if stepping away is what brings you peace, then that’s what I want most. :/

    I’m sorry. If I COULD'VE done better, I would have. And maybe I could’ve, that's what kills me to think about. But I’ll always carry that. But I want you to know something that’s never changed—I love you. I really do, and I always will. I just feel it’s better for you if I love you from a distance from now on.

    Please live your life, fully and freely. You're going to do so many incredible things—I truly believe that. Please don’t worry about me. This isn’t goodbye in a scary or sad way—just the quiet kind, the one that lets you move on without weight or guilt. That’s all I want FOR YOU now: freedom, joy, and peace.

    I’m not blocking you or cutting you off with anger. I’m just quietly stepping back, with love in my heart, so you can breathe easy again.

    If it makes it easier for you… just forget I existed. I’ll still be rooting for you.

    Take care of yourself, Andre. You’ve got this.

    —Ryan
