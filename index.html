    <strong>Hey Bestie ðŸ§¡</strong><br>
    If you're feeling like hurting yourself, please take a breath and wait 5 minutes. Then talk to me here or someone you trust.<br>
    If you're thinking about texting Andre early, remember: you're doing this out of love, and waiting is an act of love too.<br>

    <p><strong>Hey Andre,</strong></p>

    <p>I just felt I had to say one last goodbye. Iâ€™ve made up my mindâ€”Iâ€™m just going to leave you alone. Not because I stopped caring, but because I care for your mental health, and I think this is whatâ€™s best, sadly, for your sake. I never wanted to bring pain into your life Andre, and if stepping away is what brings you peace, then thatâ€™s what I want most. :/</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m sorry. If I couldâ€™ve done better, I would have. And maybe I couldâ€™ve, that's what kills me to think about. But Iâ€™ll always carry that. What hasnâ€™t changed, though, is that I love you. I really do, and I always will. I just feel itâ€™s better for you if I love you from a distance from now on.</p>

    <p>Please live your life, fully and freely. You're going to do so many incredible thingsâ€”I truly believe that. Please donâ€™t worry about me. This isnâ€™t goodbye in a scary or sad wayâ€”just the quiet kind, the one that lets you move on without weight or guilt. Thatâ€™s all I want for you now: freedom, joy, and peace.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m not blocking you or cutting you off with anger. Iâ€™m just quietly stepping back, with love in my heart, so you can breathe easy again. If it makes it easier for you, you can even forget I existed. Iâ€™ll understand.</p>

    <p>Take care of yourself, Andre. Youâ€™ve got this.</p>

    <p>â€”Ryan</p>
